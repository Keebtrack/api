SUMMARY:Rama Works M60-A
DESCRIPTION:The M60-A represents the benchmark and equilibrium between fun
 ction and design for us at Rama Works. The gently exaggerated design of th
 e frame is not understated\, but rather provocative. Inspiration and evolu
 tion from previous models are evident in the beautifully articulated desig
 n and the well defined aesthetic\, the fingerprint of our ‘Industrial Mode
 rn’ designs. The M60-A offers a unique contender in the traditional 60% fo
 rm factor.

SUMMARY:Hasbro XDA Scrabble
DESCRIPTION:Put on your thinking cap and grab some tiles (no peeking!): Ma
 ssdrop x Hasbro XDA Scrabble is ready to play—and it’s as remarkable as th
 at time you played a Q and a Z on a triple-word score. Officially licensed
  by Hasbro\, this keycap set is themed just like a Scrabble board\, from t
 he colors of the double-letter scores to the values associated with each l
 etter—and everything in between. Created by new designer and lifelong boar
 d-game fan Cassidy Williams\, it features wooden-colored alphas with a sma
 ll number in the bottom-right corner like real Scrabble letter tiles. The 
 modifiers\, styled in dark blue\, light blue\, red\, and pink\, are repres
 entative of all the bonus points you can rack up on the board. Sculpted in
  XDA profile\, the set is compatible with Cherry MX switches and clones.
